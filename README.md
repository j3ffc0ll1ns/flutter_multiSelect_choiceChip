How to use the multi-select capabilities in flutter with the choiceChip.

I read an article on Medium written by Karthik Ponnam where he does a good job of breaking down how this widget can be used.

He published his code which I cloned and subsequently edited to help me better understand how I could go from the hard coded set of List values in his example to a dynamic list retrieved from Firebase.
